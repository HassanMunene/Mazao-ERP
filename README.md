## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Performance

The backend API for the live demo is hosted on **Render's Free Tier**. Please keep in mind:

- **Cold Starts:** After inactivity, the server spins down. The first request may take **30‚Äì60 seconds** to wake up.  
-  **Subsequent Requests:** Once awake, responses are much faster.  
-  **Timeouts:** If a page seems stuck, it‚Äôs likely waiting for the backend. Please give it a moment.  


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

### Frontend
- **React 18 + TypeScript**  
  Robust, type-safe, and maintainable UI framework. TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, improving developer experience and code quality.  

- **Vite**  
  Ultra-fast build tool chosen for development and bundling. Much faster than Create React App.  

- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**  
  Provides a beautiful, accessible, and customizable component library. Enables rapid UI development without sacrificing design consistency.  

---

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express.js**  
  Flexible, minimal framework for building RESTful APIs with a vast ecosystem of middleware.  

- **Prisma**  
  Modern ORM with type-safety and intuitive data modeling. Simplifies database operations while ensuring runtime safety.  

- **PostgreSQL**  
  Reliable, robust relational database. Perfect for ERP systems handling complex relationships.  

---

### Deployment & Hosting
- **Frontend:** Deployed on **Vercel** ‚Äì seamless Git integration, auto-deployments, and excellent global performance.  
- **Backend:** Deployed on **Render** ‚Äì simple deployment for Node.js services. Free tier is used here for demo purposes.
